This too was drawn in China, on the cheap binder paper at my granduncle's house.   

This one practically drew itself. I hadn't drawn for a couple days at that point, and as soon as I found the space and materials to draw, this virtually spilled from my imagination to the paper itself. Needless to say, I'm very satisfied with how it turned out, other than the cheap paper I drew it on.
