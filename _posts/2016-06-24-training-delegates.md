(The training committee that I created is [here](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B3Cj2YytEVsjRzJOQ25WRkdVTDA&usp=sharing). Feel free to use it, if you do so I'd appreciate being credited.)


Model UN is a truly unique experience.    

It requires an unholy amalgamation of a variety of skills: A successful delegate must be familiar with speech, debate, politics, improvisation, sales, and of course international relations. When asked to describe Model UN, most people compare it to Speech and Debate, or parliamentary debate. Personally, I think the closest comparison to Model UN would be a hackathon: Model UN is, in essence, a well organized hackathon where you write resolutions rather than code. Many elements of a hackathon are there: You meet with total strangers, you all have something you want to build in mind, and at the end you present what you’ve built (in a hackathon this would be a program, in Model UN it would be your resolution) to a large group. However, even this comparison doesn’t come close to describing the quintessential Model UN experience. Describing Model UN accurately to an outsider is difficult for me. Model UN is too unique to describe, one must experience it to understand it.   

Which brings up the question: If it's difficult to just describe Model UN, how does one teach it?   

# The approach   

“By three methods we may learn wisdom: First, by reflection, which is noblest; Second, by imitation, which is easiest; and third by experience, which is the bitterest.” 
-Confucius   

Model UN cannot be taught through imitation, or reflection. No amount of research will stop someone from being politically outmaneuvered by a less researched but more aware delegate. No amount of insight into the dynamics of a committee will teach someone how to navigate and dominate that committee. No amount of imitation of an experienced delegate will unlock true understanding and mastery of the intricacies of Model UN. With imitation and reflection eliminated, we are left with Confucius’ “bitterest” method of learning: experience.    

So we should teach Model UN by letting a pupil experience Model UN. The question that remains is, how should we make this “bitterest” method less bitter?   

# Creating the perfect mock committee   

Of course, teaching through experience for Model UN translates into a mock committee of some sort. The question that remains is, what sort of traits should the ideal training committee have?    

In creating a training committee of my own, I’ve come to the opinion that there are certain doctrines one should adhere to when creating these training committees.    

# 1: KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)   

Model UN is an insanely complex activity, with a ridiculously diverse range of topics covered. However, when teaching Model UN, we should focus on teaching the core concepts of Model UN: Parliamentary procedure, the flow of committee, creating alliances, writing resolutions, etc. Without these basic skills, no delegate will have a remote chance of achieving anything in committee, let alone winning an award. The ideal training committee should not have its delegates deal with history or research. The topic background should be barebones, the political positions sparse and distinguished, and the policymaking simple. The focus should be on learning the dynamics of committee: How each of the members interact with each other, who should form an alliance with who, how to raise support and caucus for your resolution, etc. The intricacies of researching the history should be taught later.    

The mock committee I created allows the members to take on the roles of delegates in the government of Xiaodao, an imaginary country in the South China Sea. In the background guide, I mention nothing at all about the imaginary country’s history, only mentioning the political background of the country and the necessary events that have caused the topic at hand. Using an imaginary country with no history essentially isolates the social aspects of committee from the research aspects of committee, creating a more efficient and fun training experience for the new delegates.   

# 2: Don’t be boring   

The first time I participated in a mock conference, I found myself supremely disappointed at the ending. The mock was a GA committee. We had just finished spending 3 hours writing resolutions and voting on them. My resolution had passed, but I had no way of knowing how the laws I had written had impacted anything at all. I felt cheated: I spent 3 hours writing a piece of legislation, and didn’t even get to see how it impacted anything.   

People often join Model UN wanting to make a difference, and when they fail to see the resolutions they write doing anything, they begin to find Model UN uninteresting. For Model UN clubs, which often have to compete with Speech and Debate clubs for membership, being seen as “boring” can doom them to failure. Gaining members requires one to provide a fun experience, and feeling powerful is fun. As such, a mock committee should be structured as a crisis committee, such that the delegates get to pass many resolutions and see the impacts of all of them.    

In short, a GA committee spends hours deliberating on resolutions and never gets to see how they impact anything. A crisis committee can pass dozens of resolutions and see the creative (or destructive) impact of all of them.   

I think it's fairly obvious which one newcomers would find more enticing.   

# 3: Don’t make them do work   

For the Xiaodao Crisis Committee that I created, I wrote a short blurb outlining each person’s positions and possible alliances. In other words, I did their research and wrote their position for them.    

Many newcomers struggle with the idea of creating a position for their character or country. They don’t know how to use economic statistics and historical facts to “deduce” what their country wants from a certain topic. As such, I’ve removed this hurdle by writing each delegate’s position for them. Creating your own political position is an extremely important skill in Model UN, perhaps one of the most important ones. As such, it should be isolated and taught independently, which is why I’ve removed that aspect from my training committee by writing each person’s position for them. Others creating a mock committee should do the same.   

# Final thoughts   

Designing a training committee posed many challenges. However, through utilizing the doctrines I’ve outlined above, I believe creating/using a training committee is ultimately the best way to teach Model UN. By letting delegates experience firsthand the phenomenon that is Model UN, we can ignite their interest and ensure that the next generation of delegates has the skills and knowledge it needs to thrive.    

Confucius thought that experience was the “bitterest” way to learn. Indeed, experiencing actual Model UN committees, complete with competition and backstabbing, can be a very bitter way to learn. However, by deliberately designing a training committee, one can make learning Model UN a fun and rewarding experience. One could even say, a sweet experience.
