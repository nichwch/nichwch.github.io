Just got back from a 2 week trip to China, drew these while I was there. The only paper there was binder paper and I had to fold it on the flight back, which is why there's a fold in the middle of the paper.          

As a kid I really liked to play with nerf guns, and the figure of the toys must have became etched in my subconscious or something, because I now have a nasty habit of doodling futuristic guns wherever I can (my math notebook, scrap paper lying around, etc).
This time, I actually settled down to carefully draw a couple guns, rather than just offhand doodling them as I usually do.
