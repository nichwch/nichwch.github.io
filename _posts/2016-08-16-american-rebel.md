I've been doing a loooot of AP US History Reading lately. Today I had the luxury of free time after finishing my homework, so I decided to draw. Turns out, the APUSH reading left its mark on more than just my schedule.

Obviously not a historically accurate American rebel. I guess its alternate history then.
