(Obligatory spoiler alert, but I’m sure spoilers are already all over the internet, seeing that the film was released months ago)

I recently had the opportunity to watch Star Wars: The Force Awakens a second time. The movie’s quality has been a point of contention amongst many reviewers, but I noticed that many of them said that watching the movie a second time was worth doing, and after having done so I have to agree. Regardless of its quality, The Force Awakens is a film rich with meaning and history, such that its complete value cannot be appraised in one sitting.

# The second time around

Watching any film a second time will invariably yield a different experience, but The Force Awakens becomes a completely different animal. 

For one, the movie is chock full of fan service, with big and flashy reveals of old characters and beloved artifacts. The first time I watched the movie was in a theater, and the audience clapped during every big reveal: When Rey and Finn boarded the Millennium Falcon, or when Han giddily exclaimed “We’re home!” to his furry friend, the theater quickly filled with the joyful cries of fans seeing their old favorites rendered anew. These moments become less powerful and emotional the second time around. You expect the Millennium Falcon when Rey exclaims that “the other ship is garbage”, and the tension present in the scene when Rey and Finn are drawn into Han’s smuggling ship is gone. The Force Awakens relies heavily on emotional reveals of beloved characters, and these moments have significantly less value after their initial reveal. 

This clearly illustrates one of the weaknesses of the film. Immediately after release, powerful reveal moments like these drive fans crazy, increasing the movie’s media presence and driving its box office ranking through the roof. To a certain extent, these reveal moments were my favorite parts of the film the first time watching it: Who doesn’t like to see their childhood heroes return to the big screen? However, these moments overshadow more important aspects of the film’s plot. Most viewers only watch a film once, and its easy to let one’s nostalgia overshadow the plot of The Force Awakens the first time watching it.

The appeal of big character reveals disappears after watching The Force Awakens the first time. In its place however, comes an appreciation of The Force Awakens’ more nuanced elements. 

# A nuanced villain…

I didn’t like Kylo Ren’s character at all the first time watching the film. The film quickly establishes Kylo Ren’s badassery, from his complete ruthlessness in ordering the slaughter of an entire village, to him blocking a laser bolt with his mastery of the Force. His complete dominion over his adversaries’ minds is shown when he Force-tortures Poe Dameron. To me, a big part of his scary persona was his mask: It hid his emotions and made him seem evil and ruthless. As such, I simply couldn’t understand why the film had Kylo Ren remove his mask. For me, it completely neutered a villain I had come to respect and fear. The rest of the film further emasculated Kylo Ren for me, with him breaking down and confessing his pull to the light side in front of Han Solo. Being defeated by someone with no formal training in the Force or lightsaber combat was the final nail in Kylo Ren’s coffin, and completely wrecked my opinion of the villain.

However, after watching the film a second time, I can now somewhat appreciate J.J. Abrams’ vision for the character. I had expected Kylo Ren to be a force of evil similar to Darth Vader, a constant and unwavering embodiment of the dark side of the force bent on destroying the Resistance. Interpreted through that lens, the character is a failure. The second time watching the film, I adjusted my expectation for Kylo Ren and found my experience to be much more enjoyable. Kylo Ren was meant to be a tragic figure, an evil character that holds immense power and yet finds himself attracted to the light. Interpreted through that lens, the character makes a lot of sense and the movie flows much better.

# …in a not so nuanced film

The problem is, nothing else in the film is as nuanced as Kylo Ren’s character, and as such most viewers most likely held my expectation for Kylo Ren as a badass killing machine. The overall arc of the movie is strikingly similar to Episode IV: It starts off with a desert dweller finding a droid that has plans of utmost importance to a Rebellion, a planet-destroying-behemoth is revealed and used by the bad guys, and the desert dweller bands with a team of misfits and the Rebellion to destroy said planet-destroying-behemoth. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with a simple plot. It worked for Episode IV, and after the failures of the Prequels, it seemed evident that most fans just wanted the classic Star Wars formula. Would the movie have been better with an original plot? Yes. Could it have been decent with a simple plot? Also yes. Formula plots can indeed make good movies. The biggest flaw with The Force Awakens is that it blends a nuanced villain with a formula plot. The formula plot and beginning sets up the viewer’s expectation for a formula villain, only to break that expectation. The film promises viewers a nostalgic trip back to the Star Wars universe, badass sith lords and all, only to reveal the Sith lord as a tragic, nuanced villain, breaking the viewer’s expectation.

# Overall thoughts

The most important thing about a movie is whether you like it or not. Did I like the Force Awakens?

Yeah, I did. But only after watching it a second time. The first time, I enjoyed the movie for the flashy character reveals and the action, and disliked it for the “weak” villain. Only after watching it a second time did I come to appreciate Kylo Ren’s character. That being said, I do believe The Force Awaken has set the scene perfectly for a more pointed and less formulaic sequel. The weaknesses of the film, such as an out of place villain and an underdeveloped protagonist, could easily become strengths for the trilogy, sowing seeds that later blossom into a developed and original plot.
